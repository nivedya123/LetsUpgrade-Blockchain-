a)Current Block Hash      b) Data Record of current block           c) Previous Block Hash
d) Signature                e)Mining Key

QUES 5. How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained ?
Ans: It  can be attained by
Block 1        :         0 + new data = Key1
Block2         :       Key1 + new data = Key2   chain continues.
